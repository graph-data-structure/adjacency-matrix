# Usage

> :warning: Depending on your environment, the code may require

> [regenerator-runtime/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime).

First, require the polyfill at the entry point of your application
```js
await import('regenerator-runtime/runtime.js');
// or
import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime.js';
```

Then, import the library where needed
```js
const {Graph, DiGraph} = await import('@graph-data-structure/adjacency-matrix');
// or
import {Graph, DiGraph} from '@graph-data-structure/adjacency-matrix';
```
